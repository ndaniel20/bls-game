# bls-game 
An **incomplete** football web game, that uses [Futbin](https://fminside.net/) players and incorperates them into different simulate match gamemodes. 
This game is inspired by the EA FC Ultimate Team game and incorperates several elements of it.
- Searching and purchasing players to upgrade your team
- Chemistry and overall ratings
- Custom tactics
- Take part of top 5 league seasons or Champions League
- Friendly kick off matches

Some things that aren't yet completed include:
- Pack opening
- Sign up page
- Setting pages
- Online game modes

To run the game run the following command
```
node server.js
````
and open up a `http://localhost:5500/` tab and wait for it to load. 

Caching the player faces may take awhile at the start as theres 3000+ players to upload into the browser storage
